# DevOps Checklist

> **Focus:** CI/CD pipelines, deployment processes, and operational practices.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Assessment

### Pipeline Overview
- [ ] Identify CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
- [ ] Review pipeline configuration files
- [ ] Map deployment stages (dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production)
- [ ] Check automated testing integration
- [ ] Assess deployment frequency and success rate

### Build Process
- [ ] Automated builds on code changes
- [ ] Build artifacts are versioned
- [ ] Build process is reproducible
- [ ] Build time is reasonable (<10 minutes preferred)
- [ ] Build failures are properly handled

```bash
# Check CI/CD configuration files
find . -name ".github" -o -name ".gitlab-ci.yml" -o -name "Jenkinsfile" -o -name "azure-pipelines.yml"

# Review recent pipeline runs
gh run list --limit 10  # GitHub Actions
```

### Testing in Pipeline
- [ ] Unit tests run automatically
- [ ] Integration tests included
- [ ] Code coverage reporting
- [ ] Security scans integrated
- [ ] Performance tests (if applicable)

> üí° **Pro tip:** Look for test results and coverage trends over time.

## üîÑ Deployment Process

```

### Alerting
- [ ] Critical alerts defined

- [ ] Runbook documentation
- [ ] Escalation procedures
- [ ] Communication protocols

### Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Automated backup procedures
- [ ] Backup testing and validation
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan
