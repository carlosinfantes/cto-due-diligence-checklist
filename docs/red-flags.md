- [ ] **Slow feature delivery** compared to team size
- [ ] **Bug fix rate** higher than feature delivery
- [ ] **Long code review** cycles
- [ ] **Frequent context switching** between projects
- [ ] **Estimation accuracy** consistently poor

### Communication
- [ ] **Unclear requirements** or changing scope
- [ ] **Poor stakeholder** communication
- [ ] **Technical decisions** not documented
- [ ] **Knowledge silos** within team
- [ ] **Resistance to change** from team

## üîç How to Investigate Red Flags

### Code Analysis
```bash
# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "password\|api_key\|secret" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" .

# Find large files (potential god objects)
find . -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" | xargs wc -l | sort -n | tail -10

# Check for TODO/FIXME comments
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" . | wc -l
```

### Git History Analysis
```bash
# Check commit frequency
git log --since="6 months ago" --oneline | wc -l

# Find contributors
git shortlog -sn | head -10

# Check for large commits (potential code dumps)
git log --oneline --stat | grep -E "files? changed" | sort -n | tail -10
```

### Dependency Analysis
```bash
# Python: Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Node.js: Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Check for unused dependencies
# Python: pip-check
# Node.js: depcheck
```

## üéØ Remember

> **Red flags are not necessarily deal breakers** - they're indicators that require deeper investigation and potentially significant investment to address.

> **Context matters** - A startup's technical debt tolerance is different from an enterprise acquisition.

> **Document everything** - Red flags need evidence and clear remediation plans.

> **Quantify impact** - Translate technical issues into business risk and cost.
