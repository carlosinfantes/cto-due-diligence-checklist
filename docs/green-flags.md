## 💡 Pro Tips

> **Green flags compound** - teams with good practices tend to have multiple green flags

> **Look for consistency** - green flags across all areas indicate mature engineering culture

> **Verify claims** - don't just take documentation at face value, test and validate

> **Consider trajectory** - improving trends are as valuable as current state

> **Team interviews** often reveal green flags not visible in code review

---

**Remember:** Green flags indicate not just current quality, but the team's ability to maintain and improve quality over time.
