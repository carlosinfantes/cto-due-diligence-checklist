- ⚠️ **PCI DSS:** Partially compliant (using Stripe but storing card metadata)
- ❌ **SOC 2:** No compliance framework in place

#### Recommendations
1. **Immediate (24-48 hours):**
   - Rotate all exposed API keys
   - Fix SQL injection vulnerability
   - Implement input validation on all endpoints

2. **Short-term (1-4 weeks):**
   - Implement proper secret management (AWS Secrets Manager)
   - Add MFA for admin access
   - Set up automated security scanning in CI

3. **Long-term (1-6 months):**
   - GDPR compliance implementation
   - SOC 2 Type II certification
   - Regular penetration testing
